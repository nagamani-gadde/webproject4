      <p>In medicine, a surgeon is a medical doctor who performs surgery.
         Even though there are different traditions in different times and places,
          a modern surgeon is a licensed physician and received the same medical training as physicians before specializing in surgery.
         In some countries and jurisdictions, the title of 'surgeon' is restricted to maintain the integrity of the craft group in the medical profession. 
         A specialist regarded as a legally recognized surgeon includes podiatry, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.
          It is estimated that surgeons perform over 300 million surgical procedures globally each year.</p>
